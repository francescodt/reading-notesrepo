# Structure  
## Structure is important because it's how you draw attention  
### It's what brings you from here  
*To here*  

## It helps highlight what is important  
### To things that are mildly important  
**To something that is more content related**  

# Html describes the structure of pages  
### formatting the page is possible and done through elements like:  
- Body  
- Headers  
- Footers  
- h1   
- p   
- tons of other things   

Elements generally have an opening and closing tag.  

### Opening with Doctypes and why it matters  
There are tons of versions of HTML. HTML4, HTML5, xHTML1.0, etc. Signifying which one you have going on at the beginning of a page is important.  

### Things you can do inside pages that aren't elements  
 - <*!-- --> Will allow you to add a comment that won't be visible in the browser. Can also be used for things like citing sources in your work.  

 - <*id=""> attribute is used to uniquely identif that element from other elements on it's page. This should only be used once per HTML page. This is a global attribute.  

 - <*class=""> can be carried by any HTML element. This is meant for identifying several elements. 

 ### Some elements start new lines, some stay inline.  
Elements that are block elements are:  
 - h1  
 - p  
 - ul  
 - li  

Elements that are inline elements are:  
 - a  
 - b  
 - em  
 - img  

 ## HTML5 and why it's great  
 You don't need to use div classes for each header/footer/body/head argument.  
 ### Onto the elements  
_Header and Footer tags_ - The main header tag is good for navigation and things you want your viewer to see.  
 The footer tag is good for copyright information or, rather than searching navigation, direct links to things they might be looking for.  
_Nav_ - Used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as primary navigation.   
_Article_ - Container for content. Generally stand alone information and potentially be syndicated.  
_Aside_ - FLOATS. Moves your articles or elements with content to different areas on your page.  
_Section_ - Element groups related content together and typically each section would have it's own heading.  
_Figure_ - Can be used to contain any ontent that is referenced from the main flow of an article.  
- Common usage is Images, Videos, Graphs, Diagrams, Code samples, etc.

## Site maps and Wireframes  
_Site maps_ help with what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.  
_Wireframes_ are the structure on where you'll need to fill out everything. Without design, it shows the hieracrchy of the information and how much space it might require.  

Getting across your message using design  
- Content  - focus on the ability of organizing and prioritizing the information you're putting out
- Prioritizing - Make parts look distinct from surrounding content
- Organizing - Grouping together realted ontent into blocks or chunks can assist
- Visual Hierarchy - Attention drawn by certain colors, figures or eye catching material
