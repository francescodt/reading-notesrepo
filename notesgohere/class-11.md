## Images
Aligning images is not fun. You can float the image and then use align-left, align-right, and align-center. If you use the third option you will also need to set the margin to auto, or both the left and right to 0 in order to get it to line up.  
Background images allow you to place images behind html. You can repeat the image as well so that it shows up like wall paper. Other things you can do with it are:  
- repeat
- repeat-x
- repeat-y
- no-repeat  
- fixed
- scroll

Be careful with background images as they generally already have a high contrast, you will most likely want to lower it in pixlr, gimp, canva, etc.
