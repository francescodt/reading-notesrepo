## Covering semantic mark-up and structural mark-up   

_Heading tags_ you can use in your HTML that list from < h1> to < h6>. H1 for main headings, h2 for subheadings, and the rest for whatever you'd like.   
_Paragraphs_ < p> to create a pargraph when you're writing. By default the browser does show each paragraph on a new line with some space between each paragraph.  
_Bold_ < b> allows you to bold text inside the tags.  
_Italics_ < i> allows you to italicize text inside the tags.  
_Superscript and Subscript_ < sup> and < sub> allow you to raise or lower text, for things like exponents, fractions, elements, and references.  

_Strong and emphasis_ < strong> makes lettering bold, where < em> makes lettering italicized.  
_Quotations_ < blockquote> is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph.  
_Abbreviations & acronyms_  < abbr> is used to show for acronyms if you hover over what you write. < abbr title="">word</ abbr>  
_Citations_ < cite> lets you indicate where the citation is from. 
_Definition_ < dfn> used for the first time you explain new terminology in a document. 

## CSS and why it's my least favorite of everything  
CSS associates style rules with HTML elements. A CSS rule will contain a selector and a declaration.  
CSS properties affect how elements are displayed. Inside the curly brackets is a property and a value, seperated by colons. You can specify multiple properties in one declaration.
