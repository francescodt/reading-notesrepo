How to create a solid wireframe-
Figuring out how you want the site to flow. 'User Journey'.

Managing width vs padding, border, etc
width: calc(50% - 80px)
    - takes care of additonal pixels that get added in after you've declared your percent

border-box also does something similar, and takes care of nonsense

floats -
clear: both;
overflow: hidden;

margin auto only works for block level elements
if you display inline block when you float, you can last-child/first-child to float, and text-align center will get the center element to move

fixing content behind the footer:
set height on fixed footer-
on the body, add padding to the height of the footer + a little extra;






keep your padding / margin consistent. If you use 30, use it the entire time if you can.
